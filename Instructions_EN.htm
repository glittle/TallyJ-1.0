    <li>Definitions <dl>
      <dt>Election <dd>Scheduled event where voters submit ballots
        <dt>Ballot <dd>A list of names, submitted by a Voter. Usually a piece of paper. Each
          ballot consists of a specific number of votes (e.g. 9 names for Assembly elections).
          <dt>Vote <dd>Name of one individual. A vote is written on a ballot.
            <dt>Community List <dd>For the purposes of elections (and TallyJ), a community is
              the group of people who are eligible to <strong>vote</strong> and be <strong>voted
                for</strong> in the election. This usually consists of the adult Bahá'ís in good-standing
              living in a particular geographic area. If others (children, youth, ineligible adults,
              etc.) are included in the community list, they will not be seen in TallyJ except
              for the complete community reports.
              <dt>Electee <dd>A person who has been voted for in an election
                <dt>Elected<dd>An electee who has received enough votes to rank in the top 9 (for
                  Assembly elections) positions
                  <dt>Voter/Elector <dd>A person who is permitted to submit a ballot (e.g. adults in
                    community or delegates)
                    <dt>Tellers <dd>Individuals tasked to count votes cast and report the results to the
                      community
                      <dt>Spoiled Ballot <dd>A ballot not containing the required number of distinct votes.
                        All votes on the ballot are ignored.
                        <dt>Spoiled Vote <dd>A vote that is not readable or is for someone who is ineligible
                          to receive a vote. The rest of the votes on the ballot are still counted.
                          <dt>Ineligible <dd>A person who is not an adult member in good standing of the community
                            <dt>Tally <dd>The act of counting the votes in an election.</dd>
                              <dt>TallyJ <dd>A computer program designed to assist tellers in the tallying of ballots
                                in a Bahá'í election.</dd>

            Updated for version 1.70</div>
          <p>TallyJ is a set of "web pages" that are copied to your computer and run from there.
            They do not need or use a connection to the internet or a web server. The only requirements
            are a Windows XP, Vista or 7 computer with Internet Explorer 8 and MS XML Core Services
            6 (already installed on most computers).</p>
          <p>To install TallyJ, download the most current ZIP file from the "Downloads" section
            of the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/tallyj/" target="code">TallyJ Code</a>
            site. The contents of the ZIP file must be extracted into a folder on your computer.
            Later, if you need to install an updated version of TallyJ, the new files can be
            extracted to the same folder and overwrite the existing files. (Your custom data
            files will not be affected.)</p>
          <p>When you run TallyJ, it will tell you if you need to install MS XML Core Services.
            If you do, you will find a link to it in the "Links" section of the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/TallyJ-Support-Page/131404030259859"
              target="fb">TallyJ Support Page</a> on Facebook. </p>
          <p>To run TallyJ, simply double-click on the "TallyJ.hta" file in the folder where
            the TallyJ files were extracted to. If you are asked for confirmation that you want
            to open it, please provide it. A shortcut to this file could be created and moved
            to your Desktop or Quick Launch area for easy access later.</p>
          <p>On election day, all computers that are networked together can use a <b>common
            set</b> of TallyJ files. However, if TallyJ will be used on computers that are not
            connected together, repeat these steps on each computer (preferably, before the
            election). </p>
          <p></p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><a name="Practice">Practice using TallyJ</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>After opening the TallyJ.hta files for the first time, click the <b>Files</b> button
            at the top. In the list of files shown, double-click "SampleElection" and "SampleCommunity".
            TallyJ will now use these two files on each page and each time you use TallyJ until
            you change it here.</p>
          <p>The <b>Election</b> page is where the details of the election are entered. </p>
          <p>The <b>Community</b> page is where the names of people in the system can be viewed
            and modified. </p>
          <p>The <b>Ballots</b> page is for the entry of ballots and votes. See the section
            below about entering the ballots into TallyJ for details.</p>
          <p>The <b>Reports</b> page provides a variety of reports about the ballots entered.
            Try viewing each report and understand what each shows.</p>
          <p>The <b>Save</b> button appears whenever some information needs to be saved. The
            Save button sometimes does not appear until the cursor is moved out of the entry
            box, or you click anywhere on the page. <strong>Caution</strong>: pressing the F5
            key at any time will reload the application and if there was a Save needed, the
            unsaved data will be lost.</p>
          <p>On each page, some words have one letter u<u>n</u>derlined (like that). Holding
            the ALT key while typing that letter or number will click the button or move to
            that spot on the page.</p>
          <p>To close TallyJ, simply close the window. (As long as the Save button is not visible,
            all ballots and votes are saved to the current Election file.) </p>
          <p>It would be prudent to include a "computer-savvy" person among the tellers to ensure
            that computer problems do not delay the tallying process!</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><a name="PrepC">Prepare a Community file</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>When entering the names appearing on a ballot, data entry is made much faster if
            an accurate Community List has been loaded ahead of time. This list should contain
            the names of all the eligible members of the community.</p>
          <p>The Community file is an XML file in ANSI format (not UTF or Unicode) that is structured
            in a particular way. It could look something like:</p>
          <blockquote class="XMLSample">&lt;Community Name="Calgary"&gt;<br>
            &nbsp; &lt;Person LName="Chang" FName="Francisco"/&gt;<br>
            &nbsp; &lt;Person LName="Danúe" FName="Änj"/&gt;<br>
            &nbsp; &lt;Person LName="Smith" FName="John" AKAName="Johnny"/&gt;<br>
            &nbsp; &lt;Person LName="Smith" FName= "John" AKAName= "JohnA." BahaiId= "W20323"/&gt;<br>
            &nbsp; ...<br>
            &lt;/Community&gt; </blockquote>
          <p>The actual file has more attributes on the first line and some extra lines above
            that. A template community file is supplied. You should copy that file, then edit
            the new file and insert the &lt;Person&gt; lines for your community. If you have
            a list of names in something like MS Excel, you can use Excel to format the names
            as shown and then copy them into your new file. </p>
          <p>Tools to assist in creating the list may be available on the TallyJ web site.</p>
          <p>Each &lt;Person&gt; line must include the <b>LName</b> and <b>FName</b> attributes.
            If there are two or more people with the same name, an <b>AKAName</b> can also be
            supplied to distinguish between them and shows on the screen as "Other Info". If
            desired, a <strong>BahaiId</strong> can be provided, but this is in no way required
            by TallyJ. The <strong>Tie Break Resolution</strong> is not required and is generally
            entered only when there is a tie-vote at the election.</p>
          <p>If a Community file is not completely filled beforehand, it can be added to as
            the ballots are entered. If the Community file is empty when starting the tally,
            a setting on the Ballot page will let you choose to show "Add to List" for all ballots.</p>
          <p>Usually, during an election, the list of people may be reviewed and adjusted by
            the tellers. Use the <b>Community</b> page to add, correct and remove names from
            the list. If this is done after some ballots have been entered, all ballots with
            the changed person will need to be updated to match the new name. </p>
          <p>The Community list can be <strong>printed</strong> from the Reports page in a number
            of different formats. This can be used to produce paper lists for use by electors
            and tellers at the election.</p>
          <p>If more than one computer will be used to enter the ballots and they are not sharing
            a common Community file, and a Community file is not prepared, extreme caution must
            be taken to ensure that one individual's name is not entered in two different formats
            or spelling. If the two names are not precisely identical, TallyJ will consider
            them to be two separate people and report the results as such, splitting the votes
            between the two variations of the name.</p>
          <p>Load the Community file into TallyJ from the Data folder using the <b>Files</b>
            page:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Copy the file into the Data folder</li>
            <li>Click the "Files" button in TallyJ. You should see "Files in the Data Folder"
            </li>
            <li>Your file should be in the list near the center of the screen. You may need to
              click "Refresh List". </li>
            <li>Click on the file in the list. A button called "Load Community File" will appear
              if the file is valid. </li>
            <li>Click the "Load Community File" button. This will load that file and use it as
              the community file. </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><a name="PrepE">Prepare the Election File</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>An Election file is created on the <strong>Files</strong> page. Name the new file
            according to the election being recorded, e.g. "LSA 2003.xml". After creating the
            file, load it and go to the <strong>Election</strong> page to configure the contents
            of the file.</p>
          <p>Before the first ballot is entered, the Election file must be told what to expect.
            On the <b>Election</b> page of TallyJ, the number of votes to appear on each ballot
            is selected. For Assembly elections, "Number to Elect" should be set to 9. For Unit
            or other elections, choose the required number. The other configuration information
            can be added or adjusted later.</p>
          <p>If more than one computer will be used to enter the ballots, a separate Election
            file must be prepared for each computer. One file should be considered the "<strong>master</strong>"
            file. After the ballots are entered, the "other" election files will be <strong>merged</strong>
            into the master file for counting and reporting. The configuration details of the
            master file should be carefully set. For the other files, only the "Code for this
            Computer" detail needs to be set. Each file must have a unique code. This is used
            to "tag" the ballots being entered with a unique Id. Typically, the master election
            file will be created, loaded and the election information set, and saved; then that
            file is duplicated to create all the other Election files; then each of the new
            Election file is loaded and the "Code" is changed and saved.</p>
          <p><i>For instance, if 5 laptops will be networked together and all accessing a folder
            on computer M, the TallyJ files are installed on computer M with a Community file
            (Community.xml) and a master Election file (ElectionMaster.xml). In the ElectionMaster.xml,
            the "Code for this Computer" is set to, say, M. Four duplicates of the Election
            file are created called ElectionA, ElectionB, ElectionC and ElectionD. Each Election
            file is then loaded and the "Code for this Computer" is changed to match the file
            name: A, B, C or D. Later, for reporting, these 4 files will be merged with the
            master file.</i></p>
          <p>Election files are stored in XML format in the Data folder. At any time, they can
            be manually copied to a backup location, such as a memory stick or another computer,
            and archived for safety.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><a name="Alter">Technical Alterations</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p><b>Ballot Size</b> - the number of names that can appear on a ballot for Assembly
            elections is usually 9. For bi-elections, the number is smaller. For Unit Elections,
            the number to be elected may be more than 9 for larger communities. TallyJ currently
            sets that limit at 30. If you need to increase that number, two changes need to
            be made in the <i>election.xsd</i> file: the <i>NumberToElect</i> attribute and
            <i>maxOccurs</i> in the Ballot/Vote element.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><a name="Setup">Setup the Computers at the Election Site</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>On the day of the election, the tellers' computers must be setup at the election
            site.</p>
          <p>A <em>suggested setup </em>includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>As many computers as needed, about 1 per every 50 ballots expected</li>
            <li>Two tellers for each computer </li>
            <li>One printer, attached to the "master" computer </li>
            <li>A network router or hub and wiring to connect all computers together. A wireless
              router can be used if the computers/laptops support it.</li>
            <li>Enough power bars to supply all computers, monitors, hubs, printers, etc.</li>
            <li>Extension cords long enough to supply power to the location where the tellers
              will be counting votes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Assistance in setting up the computers can be provided by non-tellers, such as
            the people who may be lending their computers during the election and/or local computer
            "experts".</p>
          <p>The "master" computer is where the printer is attached and where the data files
            are stored and collected. This should typically be the fastest or most capable of
            the computers. Be sure to test printing to the printer before leaving home to verify
            that the correct printer drivers are installed, etc. </p>
          <p>If you have the equipment to network the computers, do so - it makes tallying the
            votes faster and easier. Once connected, be sure that all the other computers can
            connect to and view the TallyJ folder on the "master" computer. This may require
            setting up new login IDs or sharing existing IDs. Be sure that at least one teller
            is aware of all the IDs and passwords needed to establish the required network connections.</p>
          <p>Arrange the computers so that two people can be in front of each computer - one
            typing, and the other reading the names off the ballot papers, writing the Ballot
            Id on each ballot paper, and verifying the names as they are being typed. If only
            one teller is at the computer, the process still works, but is a little slower.</p>

        <div class="Plain">

          <p>If the computers are networked, they can and should share a common TallyJ folder.
            All of them can run the same TallyJ.hta file. A separate copy of the election file
            should be used for each computer. From each computer, open TallyJ.hta that is located
            in the <strong>shared </strong>folder. Then load the common Community file and the
            computer-specific Election file.</p>
          <p>If the "Code for this Computer" configuration has not been set, do so before entering
            any ballots. Each computer MUST have its own code and Election file.</p>

      <li><a name="Collect">Collect the Ballots</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>The procedure used to collect the ballots at the election is not prescribed by
            TallyJ. Each community and country may have their own prescribed methods for doing
            this.</p>
          <p>As an <em>example</em> of how this might be done...</p>
          <p>Completed ballot slips are placed into unmarked envelopes by voters. At a central
            location, the ballots are placed in two types of ballot boxes (<em>Present </em>
            and <em>Dropped Off</em>) and the tellers mark on a community list beside the name
            of each voter whether they 1) voted in person (<em>Present</em>), or, 2) their sealed
            ballot was delivered by mail or hand (<em>Dropped Off</em> ).</p>
          <p>When the time for voting is finished, the ballot boxes are opened in private by
            the tellers, the ballots are removed from the envelopes, and a careful count is
            made of all the ballots. The totals are compared to the marked up community lists
            to ensure that all ballots, whether <em>Present</em> or <em>Dropped Off</em>, are
            accounted for. Collecting the ballots into stacks of 10 may help the counting process.
            (Important: When opening the ballot envelopes, if a ballot is found to be torn or
            separated by name, be sure to tape them together so that the ballot remains as a
            single unit.)</p>
          <p>Once the counts are confirmed, the tellers can begin entering the ballots into
            TallyJ on the computer(s).</p>
          <p><em>(The sample process described above is not an officially prescribed process,
            just an example of what one community has done.)</em> </p>

            the tallying process. When a system like TallyJ is <em>not </em>being used, tellers
            have often cut ballots into individual votes to facilitate manual collating and
            counting. This should NOT be done when using TallyJ. (In fact, any ballots received
            on more than one piece of paper must be taped together to form a single ballot!)</p>
          <p>To enter a ballot in TallyJ, <u>click the <strong>Add New</strong> button</u> on
            the <b>Ballots</b> page. A new identification (Id) number is immediately created
            and displayed near the top of the page. This Id consists of the unique "Code" for
            this computer followed by a number, e.g. "A.12". <b><u>Write this Id on the paper
              ballot</u></b> to make review and checking possible. All tellers should write
            the ballot Ids in the same location on the paper, for instance, in the top-right
            corner. Using a red pen is preferred.</p>
          <p>For each name on the ballot, <u>begin</u> typing the name into the "Search" column.
            As you do, the Community list in the <b>Names</b> area will display the all the
            names matching what has been typed so far. Continue typing until the correct name
            can be seen. Press the <strong>Up </strong>or <strong>Down </strong>keys to move
            the highlighting in the List, and when the correct name is highlighted, press <strong>
              Enter</strong>.</p>
          <p>When <strong>Enter</strong> is pressed, the complete name from the list is automatically
            copied into the Vote. Repeat for the next name on the ballot.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>If <em>too many</em> names have been put on the ballot, click "<strong>Too Many
              Names?</strong>" at the top. If desired, the names on the paper can be entered into
              TallyJ.</li>
            <li>If <em>too few</em> names have been entered, leave the last vote line(s) blank.
              After clicking "Save Ballot", then click the "<strong>Save Invalid Ballot</strong>"
              to save the ballot. The ballot status will be set to "Too Few" and not be included
              in the final count.</li>
            <li>If a name on the paper is not readable, or is for a person known not to be in
              the Community, click the "S" button on the line.</li>
            <li>If the name is valid, but is not yet in the Community list, click the "+" button
              then enter the full name carefully in the spaces provided. The name will be <strong>
                added</strong> to the local Community list when the "Check &amp; Save Ballot"
              button is clicked. <em>If using a common Community file between more than one computer,
                everyone else should immediately click the "R" beside the Community name in the
                top right corner of their screen. If not using a common Community file, carefully
                ensure the same name is entered identically on the other computers, or copy the
                updated Community file to the other computers.</em></li>
            <li>(If a person voted for is an adult in the community, but inelegible for election,
              you must update the person's record in the Community list to ensure it is marked
              as ineligible or is deleted from the file.)</li>
            <li>If a name is repeated twice on one ballot, you should enter the names exactly
              as seen on the paper; when the ballot is checked, the status will be set to "Dup
              Name".</li>
          </ul>
          <p><em>(Remember, throughout TallyJ, some letters in some words are underlined to
            indicate keyboard shortcuts. For instance, if a buttons says "<u>A</u>dd New", then
            pressing ALT-A will press the button or go to that spot.)</em></p>
          <p>If you start the ballot entry without a Community List loaded, you can create it
            as you enter ballots (as described above). In this case, you should check the box
            beside "<strong>Default: Add to Community List</strong>". New ballots will start
            with blank spaces available for entering names that need to be added to the List.
          </p>
          <p>In summary, try to enter what is seen on the paper as closely as possible into
            TallyJ and write the ballot Id on the paper ballot.</p>

      <li><a name="Merge">Merge the Election files (if needed)</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>If more than one computer is being used to enter ballots, the "other" Election
            files must be merged into the "master" Election file before obtaining final reports.</p>
          <p>If a common folder on a "master" computer is not being used, start by copying the
            "other" Election files to the computer and folder where the "master" Election file
            is. This can be done via diskette or memory stick if no other way is available.
            (The files are very small and hundreds could fit on one diskette.)</p>
          <p>Once the files to be merged are in the same folder as the master file, go to the
            <b>Files</b> page on the master computer. The file will be listed (click "Refresh
            List" if needed); select it, then click "Merge with Current Election". The new ballots
            in that file will be added to the Master file.</p>
          <p>If the "other" Election file being merged has been merged previously, only new
            ballots will be merged. The Ballot Id is used to determine which have been merged.
            It is therefore safe to merge the same file files multiple times as the counting
            proceeds.</p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><a name="Report">View and/or print the Election Results report</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>The <b>Reports</b> page can be used at any time to display the current election
            results. </p>
          <p>Before viewing the final reports: <ol>
            <li>The "Manual Results" on the Election page need to be filled in. </li>
            <li>The <b>Validate Ballots</b> button on the <b>Ballots</b> page the must be clicked
              to validate the status of each vote and ballot. This must be done again if any vote
              is later adjusted. </li>
          </ol>
          </p>
          <p>Print the "Election Summary" report to provide official results of the election.
            This report shows the number of votes received by the next person not elected. It
            also attempts to indicate if there is a tie.</p>
          <p>At an Annual Meeting or Unit Convention, if the community votes to have a full
            report provided with all names, the suggested report to use is called "All by Votes".
            Alternatively, the "All by Name" may be desired. </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li><a name="Tie">Resolve Tie-breaks</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>If a careful review of the results shows that there is a <strong>tie </strong>or
            a <strong>small difference in the number of votes </strong>between last person elected
            and the next electee, a careful double-check that all paper ballots where correctly
            entered in TallyJ may be required. (Without TallyJ, a full recount would be needed.)
            If a printer is available, print the "Ballots Cast" report and compare each ballot
            on the printed report to the corresponding paper ballot (according to the Ballot
            Id previously written on the paper ballot).</p>
          <p>If there is a <strong>tie</strong>, a tie-break vote must be taken unless minority
            rules apply. Once that is completed, the community list for the people involved
            in the tie should be updated to set their "Tie Break Resolution" setting. This setting
            (None, Low, High) is used when needed to break the tie. A person with High priority
            wins over a person with Low priority. Similarly, Low wins over None. Once the priority
            has been set for the tied electees, use <strong>Validate Ballots</strong> again,
            then view the report again. TallyJ is set to correctly handle 2- or 3-way ties.
          </p>
          <p>Tie-break votes are typically not tallied using TallyJ, since there is only one
            or a few names being voted for. "Traditional" paper-based tallying methods should
            be used, where the votes are sorted into piles by name and counted.</p>
          <p>For Unit Conventions where "the believers receiving the next highest number of
            votes" are reported, all ties involving these people must be resolved by tie-break
            unless minority rules apply.</p>
          <p>Some of the reports available are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>"Election Summary" - Full report with statistics and the names of the elected</li>
            <li>"Top 9" - Top 9 electees with no counts shown</li>
            <li>"Top 9+2 with Count" - Top 9 and next few with number of votes received shown</li>
            <li>"All by Votes" - All electees and how many votes were cast for them</li>
            <li>"Votes Cast" - All votes cast and their status. Invalidated votes are shown crossed
              out.</li>
            <li>"Ballots Cast" - All ballots cast and their status. Invalidated ballots and votes
              are shown crossed out. A link is provided to directly edit any of the ballots.</li>
            <li>"All by Name" - Alphabetical listing of all those receiving a vote, with the number
              of votes shown.</li>
            <li>"Summary - Ballots and Votes" - Statistical counts and summary for the election.</li></ul>
          <p>You can print any report with the <b>Print</b> button or CTRL-P. The contents of
            the report page can also be copied into another program, such as MS Word to be included
            in existing reports.</p>
          <p>PDF output files can be made by installing a PDF printer driver, and selecting
            it as the output printer. There are a number of such drivers available. One that
            seems to work well is available from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/">

      <li><a name="Archive">Archive the Election documents</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>After the election, many communities store the paper ballots for a year. A copy
            of the TallyJ folder from the Chief Teller's computer could be copied to a diskette
            and included in the archives.</p>

      <li><a name="Translate">Translating TallyJ into other languages</a>
        <div class="Plain">
          <p>As of version 1.4, TallyJ can be translated into other languages. Multiple Language
            Modules can exist side-by-side on the computer and the desired one used in TallyJ.
            Most translation is done in a copy of the "Phrases_EN.txt" file. Help files can
            also be copied and translated. All files for translation exist in the main folder
            or the "Support/Display" folder.</p>
          <p>TallyJ uses the concept of language and culture codes for identifying languages.
            For example, EN, FR, FR-CA, DE-CH, ES, etc. The "culture code" can also be used
            to make variant versions of TallyJ. </p>
          <p>Suggested steps for translating:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Copy and edit the Phrases_EN.txt file. More instructions can be found at the bottom
              of that file. Each language has its own phrases file. The phrases files form the
              core of TallyJ.</li>
            <li>(Optional) Make a copy and translate each file (in the TallyJ folder and in the
              TallyJ\Support\Display folder) that ends with _EN.htm. The new files should be named
              according to the language code being translated, e.g. Overview_DE.htm.</li>
          </ol>
