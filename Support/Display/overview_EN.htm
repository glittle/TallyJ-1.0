  <p>TallyJ facilitates the recording of ballots and votes at a Bahá'í election. It
    is designed for use at the location of the election, with the completed paper ballots
    in hand. All names on the ballots are typed into one or more computers and on-screen
    reports provide instant results. Your copy of TallyJ is currently at version <span
      id="divVersion"></span>. An updated version may be available on the TallyJ Support
    Website (see link below).</p>
