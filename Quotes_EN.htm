<li><p>Invalid Ballots Under certain conditions an 
        entire ballot may be declared invalid. These are: <br>(1) More than nine 
        names on ballot paper; <br>(2) Less than nine names on ballot paper; 
        <br>(3) Duplication of names. <br>Under other conditions, because of 
        specified irregularities, one or more of the names may be invalidated 
        but the rest of the ballot would be considered valid. These 
        irregularities are: <br>(1) A name not identifiable, or illegible; 
        <br>(2) The name of an ineligible person, such as a youth or person not 
        resident in the jurisdiction of the voting area, provided of course that 
        each ballot contains no more or less than nine names and no name has 
        been duplicated. <br><em>Letter from the Universal House of Justice, 
        dated July 29, 1971, to a National Spiritual Assembly (Compilations, NSA 
        USA - Developing Distinctive Bahá'í Communities)</em> 
	               	       </p>

<li><p>It is a basic principle of elections for Bahá'í 
        Spiritual Assemblies that each voter must vote for the nine people who, 
        in his or her opinion, are best suited to serve. He may have a low 
        opinion of all those who are eligible, but his duty is to vote for those 
        nine from among them who, in his estimation, best meet the standards for 
        service on a Spiritual Assembly. This is how it is possible to vote for 
        exactly nine names. Since the membership of an Assembly is nine, it 
        would give rise to a number of statistical anomalies if voters were 
        permitted to record votes for fewer or more than nine names. In any one 
        election there are not usually any cases where a voter accidentally 
        makes a mistake and includes a name of an ineligible person, so the 
        statistical effect is slight, and there is no need to invalidate his 
        whole ballot. As you point out, a believer who does not wish to vote for 
        nine, may achieve his end by purposely including the names of those who 
        are ineligible, but this would be a betrayal of the trust placed in him 
        as a Bahá'í voter. One cannot control such actions, but like any action 
        contrary to the spirit of the Faith, they are detrimental and should be 
        strongly discouraged. <em>(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p. 
        21)</em>                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	     </p>

<li><p>In answer to your question about who should 
        decide this matter, the House of Justice states that it is the duty of 
        the tellers to report the entire result of the voting, to the National 
        Spiritual Assembly which has a duty of accepting the tellers' report 
        before it is presented to the Convention. If the National Assembly sees 
        that the ninth place is tied and that one of the persons tied is a 
        member of a minority, it would instruct the tellers to report the 
        results on this basis without calling for a re-vote. If, however, there 
        is any doubt at all as to whether a minority is involved, the Assembly 
        should resolve the matter by instruction that a re-vote for the ninth 
        place should be held. <em>(Compilations, Lights of Guidance, p.

        <p>68. Each Voter Must Vote for the Nine Best Suited for Election -- Not 
        Betray Sacred Trust<br><br> &quot;It is a basic principle of elections for 
        Bahá'í Spiritual Assemblies that each voter must vote for the nine 
        people who, in his or her opinion, are best suited to serve. He may have 
        a low opinion of all those who are eligible, but his duty is to vote for 
        those nine from among them who, in his estimation, best meet the

        possible to vote for exactly nine names. Since the membership of an

        anomalies if voters were permitted to record votes for fewer or more

        where a voter accidentally makes a mistake and includes a name of an

        <p>85. Results Reported to National Assembly for acceptance and 
        Instructions to Tellers about Re-voting<br><br> &quot;In answer to your 
        question about who should decide this matter, the House of Justice 
        states that it is the duty of the tellers to report the entire result of 
        the voting, to the National Spiritual Assembly which has a duty of 
        accepting the tellers' report before it is presented to the Convention.

        <p>Tellers <br>The tellers are appointed by the outgoing Spiritual 
        Assembly. Any Bahá'í, adult or youth, in good standing may serve as 
        teller; however, the Chief Teller should be an adult. The task includes: 
        <br>* Collecting the ballots <br>* Counting the ballots <br>* Making 
        certain that the ballots are valid <br>* Recording the results <br>* 
        Reporting the results to the election meeting <br>* Submitting to the 
        local and National Spiritual Assembly a report signed by all tellers. 
        This report becomes part of the permanent records of the community. 
        <br><br>In addition, the Chief Teller is responsible for organizing the 
        work of the tellers, announcing the results of the election and any 
        other relevant information desired by the electors, and ensuring that 
        the election report is signed by all tellers. <em>(Compilations, NSA USA
